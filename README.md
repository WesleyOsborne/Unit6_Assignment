Harold's company has just started a new Real Estate Investment division to provide customers with a broader range of portfolio options. Harold was tasked with building a prototype dashboard, and he needs your help. The real estate team wants to trial this initial offering with investment opportunities for the Toronto market. If the new service is popular, then they can start to expand to other markets.
This dashboard's goal is to provide charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers explore the data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in Toronto.

Dashboard AID:
Tab 1 Average Household Values: Shows a map of the average cost of households across Toronto.
Tab 2, Yearly Market Analysis: Shows the number of different dwelling types from 2001 to 2016. There is a slider on the right side of the screen which you can slide to change the year.
Tab 3, Shelter Cost vs house value: shows the shelter costs (owned and rented), as well as the average housing value across Toronto by year.
Tab 4, Neighbourhood Analysis: Shows the number of dwellings per year in each neighbourhood as well as the average housing price per year. Both charts have a slider on the right hand side which can be used to change between neighbourhoods
Tab 4 Top Expensive Neighbourhoods: Shows the average housing value for top 10 most expensive Neighbourhoods between 2001-2016.
